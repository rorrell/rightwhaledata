# rightwhaledata
A Jupyter Notebook where I wrangle some data on right whale sightings and create a visualization.  I had to reformat a column as a date.  I also had to create a new dataframe that had only one instance of each date with a new column that had the counts of each date and another new column that had summed the group sizes for each date.  The visualization is a bar chart showing the counts for each definite sighting for each date in January of 2018 and it has a line on it for the total group size for each date.
